# Node.js-README-Generator


## Node.js Challenge - Professional README Generator : Week 9 Challenge


## Summary of Task
This week my Challenge was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

When creating an open-source project on GitHub, a high-quality README is crucial. It details the app's purpose, usage instructions, installation steps, issue reporting process, and contribution guidelines, which encourage developer participation. A command-line application, like this one, can quickly generate a README, allowing the project creator to focus more on development.

The application may be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

**Note:** 

Because this application is not deployed, I have provided a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality. The link to the video is provided in this README farther below.

Below are the following Challenge requirements according to the 
**User Story** & **Acceptance Criteria**

## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```


## Getting Started

Here were some additional guidelines that helped me get started:

* Created a `.gitignore` file and included `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/` so that my `node_modules` directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Created my `.gitignore` file before installing any npm dependencies.

* Made sure that my repo includes a `package.json` with the required dependencies. Created one by running `npm init` when I first started up the project, before installing any dependencies.

* Included a video of the typical user flow through my application. This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection.

* Reviewed the [Fullstack Blog Video Submission Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-literacy/video-submission-guide) for creating my video.
